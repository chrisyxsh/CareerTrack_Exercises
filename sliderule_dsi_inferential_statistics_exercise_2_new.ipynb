    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Callings of resumes is a binomial distribution or a poisson distribution. CLT can apply to it for calculating it's test statistics such as call back percentage, and the mean and confidence interval of the call back percentage. We can use bootstrap method and frequentist test method to do statistical hypothesis test. \n",

    "    There is no any difference for calling back on names of black-like or white-like. The sample shown that the number of black-call is lower than the number of white-call, is just by chance.\n",
